                    Gayathri is A Naturopath & Yoga trainer by profession, wife of a Vedic scholar and mother of a divine soul who is now 3 years.
Having studied under a normal education system, I always felt that education is just creating a void within me rather than filling me with the knowledge that I really need to bring that excellence in me. Somewhere I was missing to connect myself. 
Then by the age of 18, I happened to get into the world of Yogic lore. It was in itself a journey I had begun where it gave me second birth.
All thanks to my brother it was his decision that helped me to begin my life all over again just like how I wanted it to be.</p>

        <div class="secondphase">
            <p class="proexp">SVYASA was not just another university for the degree, it was more like learning life amidst the spiritual gurus. We studied Yoga Shastras, Bhagavadgeeta, Upanishads along with our medical curriculum. 
            Life in the university taught us to “Be & Make” that’s the mission of the university which was the crux of our education system. After completing my 5 & 1/2 years of education I served the university as Assistant professor for 2 years for BNYS, BSc Yoga & MSc Yoga courses, also I took part in several other health camps conducted by the university.

        <div class="secondphase">
            <p class="proexp">Leaving the campus after about 9yrs of my life was a tough decision, yet I was ready to face the real world out. Now it was my time to take that first move to come out of the nest where I was all safe and pampered. 
                Looked for an opportunity to work overseas & worked as a yoga trainer in Doha Qatar for a year in an Indian Arts and Music institution.
                Thereafter returning to India my journey began with my life partner Anantha Sharma, whom I chose for lifetime as a guru to learn and grow with. We both got an opportunity to work in the traditional Indian knowledge system for 4 years till 2023.
                Recently I moved to Bengaluru, to be part of this new venture Yogakshema. This is another beginning for me to be the Director, Division of Health & Fitness. Being part of Yogakshema is my dream project answered by the universe to bring me into the group headed by Aravind Prasadji.
