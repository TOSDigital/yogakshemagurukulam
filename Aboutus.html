        <div class="gurukulampara">
            <p>Ancient India was renowned for its vast treasury of wisdom and spirituality, with the gurukulas standing out as prestigious centers of knowledge and research. In those times, every village, house, and public gathering spot was an opportunity to learn and grow. This resulted in an astounding 732,000 gurukulas that existed before the adoption of modern teaching methods in the country.
                Gurukulams were once exclusive hubs of wisdom, wellness, health, and healing, with every citizen of the land eager to learn from these fountains of knowledge. Sadly, those days and memories are now just a fading memory. Today, Gurukulam for the Modern World has been reduced to a religious space rather than a center of learning. The general perception of Gurukulam is often that of a bearded man seated under a banyan tree teaching Vedas to his disciples. However, the modern mind has become increasingly ignorant or even repulsive towards Indic wisdom, wellness, health, and healing methods that have been passed down to us through various means.
                It's time to break the misconception and create a space where spiritual science meets the modern mind. At Yogakshema, we aim to revive and modernize the ancient Indian knowledge system, with a focus on integral growth and self-discovery. We offer unique insights into life, health, and wellness that empower individuals to become the best version of themselves. By blending the rich heritage of Indian wisdom with modern teaching methods, we aim to create a Gurukulam for the 21st century that is accessible and inclusive for all. Join us on this journey of self-discovery and growth! </p>

    <h1>Our Goal</h1>
    <div class="goalholder">
        <div class="leftholder hidden">
            <div class="topholder">
                <h3>Modern Life</h3>
                <p class="goal">The life that we live is such a wonderful gift that we can give to ourselves. In the name of development and growth, world today is in a crisis that we hardly imagined. Human life is experiencing different levels of crisis. Cultural, Social, Religious, emotional, intellectual and spiritual. The situation of crisis is intensifying and breaching the limits without making noise for the past many years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bottomholder">
                <h3>Problems of Modern Society</h3>
                <p class="goal">Can education actually solve our problems? What are the problems of Modern society even? Is it Politics? Caste? Religion? Corruption? Terrorism? Social Media? Violence? None of these are problems. They are the critical outcomes of the actual problem. The Real problem today is the lack of nurturing leadership, self-motivation, values and wisdom of Swadharma in our education system.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="rightholder hidden">
            <div class="topholder">
                <h3>Education in Crisis</h3>
                <p class="goal">The only way to make humans realize this crisis is through education & interaction. Unfortunately education and social communication is also in crisis today. In the name of education we have entangled the young minds into competition, conflict and chaos. Education has the capacity to manifest the true potential hidden happiness, talents and joy of living in every human being. This is possible if the Education system can imbibe values and nurture Integral growth rather than focusing on just Academic Excellence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bottomholder">
                <h3>Reviving Education System</h3>
                <p class="goal">Hence there is a need to revive our Indic Wisdom Methodology which was alive in the streets of India. Gurukulas were not just schools. Rather they were centres of ‘Life education’ that enhanced humanistic approach towards self, others and the world around. An Integral approach to Human growth is the Ultimate solution to all problems that we are facing in the society today.</p>

    <h1>Yogakshema</h1>
    <div class="hold">
    <p class="goal">Yogakshema is a word that has a deeper meaning in Sanskrit. Where ‘Yoga’ is Realization of Aspirations and ‘Kshema’ is Retention of those Realizations. Many parents, teachers and young minds aspire for well being, happiness and an Inspiring successful Life. Unfortunately we end up disappointed because, either the sources of the Indian Knowledge system are too Orthodoxical or they are just superficial. Yogakshema will be that niche where people can access Indic Wisdom, Indic Wellness, Indic Health and Indic Healing from resourceful mentors.</p>
