    <h2>Aatada Aramane</h2>
    <h3>Cultural Summer Camp</h3>
    <img class="cover" src="" alt="">
    <p class="summercampexp">Namaste All!!
        Welcome to our exclusive Cultural Summer Camp organized in Mysore for the kids aged 6-14 yrs from April10th to May 7th 2023 at Maharshi Public School.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Atada Aramane Summer Camp?</h3>
        <p class="summercampexp">
            In ancient India we had Gurukulams where the focus of education was on 5 major aspects of child development.
        </p> <br>
        <p class="summercampexp">
            The Physical, The Mental, The Intellectual, The Social and The Spiritual factors were integrally developed in a child. Gurukulams were places where children learnt and understood lifestyle in a very playful and joyful way. 
        </p> <br>
        <p class="summercampexp">
            What if there is a summer camp which will focus on all these 5 aspects of your child and plan their activities accordingly? Yes!! Atada Aramane is going to be a castle of joyful experience for your child because every activity will be fun-filled and a joyful cultural learning is going to happen. Our sessions on Theatre, Yoga Asanas, Yogic games, Cultural arts & crafts, Value based Story-Telling, Folk Dance, Music, Shlokas, Spoken Sanskrit are all focused on the 5 aspects. 
        </p> <br>
        <p class="summercampexp">
            You as a parent might find it difficult to engage your child this summer and keep them away from Mobile addiction and harmful radiations during the day. Hence this is a great opportunity to engage your child in a productive and culturally planned summer camp.
        </p> <br>
        <p class="summercampexp">
            There are many activities involved in the camp which will help your child learn communication, fearlessness, team building, leadership, compassion, self-discipline and much more. Our interaction with the Nature and Tribal People will be a unique experience for your child. Your child will realize the luxury behind every simple things provided by you as parents in their life.
